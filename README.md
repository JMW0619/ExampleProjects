Simple apps I used to build my understanding of Python

There is no licensing and the ideas are far from original.
The purpose behind these apps is to get from Idea to Function as quickly as possible, with as litle code as is required to accomplish the task.
I often lean on AI to assist in creating this code and do not want to mislead people that I'm writing these on my own.
